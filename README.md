### POKEDEX 
  Pokedex is a single-web-paged application that showcases six commonly seen pokemon within their universe. This application uses React and Express for its client/server relationship. 
  Big thanks to the developers of PokeAPI, in creating and maintaining its information base, so that open-source users can strive towards creating amazing things. 
## How to Run It:
  Access the main directory via any terminal of your choosing. Create two terminal instances, which then access each respective folder. Starting with the client-side, run _npm install_ 
  to download any necessary modules that are needed for running this app. Afterwards, run "_node server.js_: to start the Express server. Next within the later terminal instance, access the server-side directory and follow the same procedure as the former; 
  however, running "_npm run dev_" to initiate the React application. And now that the Pokedex is running, take a look and let me know what ya' think!
